ideas for BSplines:

BSplines! Check more of these:
1. Circle Meeting points -> no corner points
2. BSplines continue Knick-Punkte -> yes corner points # no, there's no such thing.

BSplines with degree 1:
1. len() <= 5 -> These are lines. If they have contact with circles, they(start/end points) not even corner points. 
2. len() > 5 -> Possibility that it's a long line. cotnact with circles?

BSplines with degree > 1:
1. Possibility that there are circle pairs? three or more BSplines to build a circle?
2. ?
3. ?

1. Make circles and Circle-Bsplines(take two splines, connect them, calculate the mean and use the distance to see if they are likely form a circle)
2. Check if BSplines are connectable. -> Class object -> a large circle?
2. BSplines with degree == 1:
	if length short:
		if it touches a circle: remove it
		elif no touch: keep it as a line, start/end point to be included in corner points.
	else: 
3. BSplines with degree > 1: # these are no parts of circles
	if length to short:
		if it touches a circle: remove it
		elif no touch: keep it as a BSpline, start/end point to be inlcluded in corner points.
	else:
