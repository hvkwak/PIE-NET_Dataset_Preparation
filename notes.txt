ideas for BSplines:

BSplines! Check more of these:
1. Circle Meeting points -> no corner points
2. BSplines continue Knick-Punkte -> yes corner points # no, there's no such thing.

BSplines with degree 1:
1. len() <= 5 -> These are lines. If they have contact with circles, they(start/end points) not even corner points. 
2. len() > 5 -> Possibility that it's a long line. cotnact with circles?

BSplines with degree > 1:
1. Possibility that there are circle pairs? three or more BSplines to build a circle?
2. ?
3. ?

# Update
Filter All curves
1. Take those with vertices < 30K AND len(all_curves_list) <= 75: ca 50% of all models. 500K still available, we want to keep evtl. 50K.
2. Take circles and make circles if they are connectable.
3. Combine Circle-Bsplines(if they exactly match)
4. Take Multiple BSplines and see if they can form a circle. Use centroid to check, allow approximately small error.
	if circle possible: build a circle, keep it as a closed curve as a whole.
	if circle not possible, keep them individually as open curves.
5. Udpat during 2-4.

BSplines should be filtered accordingly
3. For all BSplines with degree == 1:
3.1 if it's too much, let's say > 30% of all curves -> reject this model.
3.2 if there are no lines, but only BSplines with degree 1 -> reject this model
3.3 if it touches a closed circle -> remove this BSpline.
3.4 change the rest of BSplines with degree == 1 into Line.

3. BSplines with degree > 1: # these are no parts of circles
	if length to short:
		if it touches a circle: remove it
		elif no touch: keep it as a BSpline, start/end point to be inlcluded in corner points.
	else:
